                <h3>Learn Artificial intelligence in very easiest way</h3>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning (ML) isn’t new. However, the field of big data is revitalizing the subject and more organizations are relying on ML models to scale their operations, support staff in working better and faster, to uncover hidden insights from data, or even confirm and challenge underlying assumptions. This is creating widespread interest in related topics with the C-suite, and across business lines and job roles, as enterprises embrace the value of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML. To make a disruptive organizational impact, AI and ML need to be understood and trusted. By consulting these ML blogs from authoritative individuals and organizations that satisfy different skill levels, readers can increase their understanding and comfort level in these areas, get pressing questions answered, and connect with others who have experience using them to great benefit.
                    <br><br>
1. OpenAI
<br><br>
OpenAI comes from industry experts who want to bring AI to the masses. It's linked to the non-profit research company OpenAI, co-chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and sponsored by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Infosys who are trying to make AI accessible—hence the name. Contributors discuss their collective efforts to promote and advance AI technologies through long-term research. It’s a valuable resource for anyone interested in the future of AI.

10. AI at Google
<br><br>
Related links: Google AI Research Blog and Google AI Technology Blog
<br><br>
Google helped revolutionize machine learning, so to see their level of ML research isn’t surprising. Machine learning and AI critically support how Google technology works—from their search algorithms that redefined web searches, to Google Maps influencing how we navigate destinations, and now their self-driving car is changing the auto industry. Google makes its work available through posts discussing their published research and how its technology is used by others to influence AI innovation.
<br><br>
With greater understanding or appreciation for ML and AI, it’s easier to dispel the myths that may leave doubt about their full potential and to responsibly apply these productive solutions. A Tableau blog post recently explored three common machine learning misconceptions—reviewing them will help you discern fact from fiction in all the industry noise.
<br><br>
For anyone ready to embrace these models and put them to work, Andrew Beers, CTO at Tableau Software, wrote about how to effectively and responsibly apply AI techniques taking cues from brands such as Box, eBay, OpenTable, and Slack. And the rise of explainable AI (i.e. techniques in AI which can be trusted and easily understood) topped Tableau’s 2019 annual report of influential BI trends, signaling that more organizations are putting these trained, data-driven models to use in how they operate and solve complex challenges.
